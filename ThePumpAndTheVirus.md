 ## Problem being solved
 Does the change in gas prices reflect the effectiveness of self-quarantine, and thus the spread of the novel coronavirus?                 
 
 ## Possible data
 -- gas price endpoint http://www.mygasfeed.com/keys/api
County level counts, USA https://covidtracking.com/api/    

## Execution
Get api data and use high charts, lots of css.
