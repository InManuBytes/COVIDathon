## Problem being solved
Map with infections over time/testing over time. Problem solved however might just be more data to rumminate over. 

## Possible data 
there's this [Kinsha](https://healthweather.us/?regionId=49049&mode=Atypical) site  
## Execution
Using the network tab it's possible to get the info to use their API directly, explore if there's a time parameter.
Possibly might take a few of hours to be able to collect data from different endpoints in a way that can be useful
